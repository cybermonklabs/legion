/**
 * How the Codex plugin's MCP server learns which session it serves (INFRA-3558).
 *
 * Codex starts the plugin's MCP server as a child of the `codex` process with a stripped
 * environment and no session id, and runs the plugin's hooks as children of that same process
 * with the session's id in their input. So the `SessionStart` hook writes this record under the
 * `codex` process's id, and the server, whose parent that process is, reads it. `SessionStart`
 * runs at the session's first prompt and again after `/new`, with the new session's id, so the
 * server follows the record to each session the process runs. Measured on Codex CLI 0.154.0.
