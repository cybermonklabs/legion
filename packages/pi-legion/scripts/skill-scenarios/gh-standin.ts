// $SKILL_SCENARIO_RUN/calls.jsonl (argv, the contents of any file or stdin it hands GitHub a body
// through, its exit status, the agent that made the call when the run names one
// ($SKILL_SCENARIO_AGENT, a run that boots one agent per role), and the pull request body it
// kept, if any), then answered from the
// first route in $SKILL_SCENARIO_RUN/fixtures.json whose regex matches "gh <argv...>". Three
// answers are the run's own remote rather than a route's, since each is a fact of the run and no
// frozen answer could tell one run from another: the pull request's head, which a route carries
// and this answer replaces, and its diff and the comparison of two commits, which need no route
// at all (`branchDiff`, `comparison`). A call no route matches and no remote serves prints
// `gh: Not Found (HTTP 404)` and exits 1. Nothing is sent anywhere.
// `--json a,b` picks fields and `--jq`/`-q` runs jq, as gh does. A pull request body edit (`gh pr
// edit --body`, `--body-file`, or a PATCH through `gh api`) is kept: every route answering with an
// object that has a `body` then answers with the new one, as GitHub's next read would, and the
// call's record carries it as `body`.
