// assign mints the assignment this start hands role on issue, writes it onto the role's phases row
// and answers it for the start's payload. Both writes are the transition's own transaction, so the
// row names the new phase's assignment before the outbox can run that start, which is what makes
// the comparison safe: while a role's turn outlives its phase its claim still serves the earlier
// assignment (the machine refuses a second delivery while one is pending), and the row already
// names this one.
//
// Only a start that hands a role work it was not already on mints one. A resume (workflow's
// resume by rule, admission's promotion of a mid-phase child), a production check's look and a
// held phase's retry (restart) mint none, so none of them moves the row and a worker's in-flight
// completion is never refused for an assignment it was never given.
//
// The token is 26 random base32 characters (crypto/rand.Text), which is more than it needs to be:
// it is only ever compared with a value the daemon itself wrote, never read from a request — a
// completion carries no identity at all (api.HandoffCompleteRequest) — so it has to be unique
// among the assignments of one role, not unguessable. It is minted rather than derived because
// nothing at hand is unique per phase entry: the issue's generation is one run's whole life, the
// round counts only returns to implementing, and the start's own outbox row id is not known until
// the row is written.
